## What is this?
- A quick example on how to use Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)'s official API to request data, perform analysis, and plot data trends. 
You can find all imported libraries at the beginning of the .ipynb notebook (requests, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot). \
- If you want a more interactive experience working with the notebook, feel free to open the notebook in Google Colab so that you can edit cells, implement additional features, etc.
